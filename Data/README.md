## DATA DESCRIPTION
The data have been split into a test and training set. The training set, on which I trained my model(s), contains 353 images of x-rays of TB-positive lungs and 365 images of x-rays of healthy lungs. The test set contains 82 images.

## FILES
- Train.zip - you will use these images to train your model.
- Test.zip - these are the images on which you will apply your model and test your model.
- SampleSubmission.csv - is an example of what your submission file should look like. The order of the rows does not matter, but the names of the IDs must be correct.
- test.csv - list of all test file names and their ID
- train.csv - list of all train file names and their ID


> **DISCLAMER**
> Due to the competions [rules](https://zindi.africa/competitions/runmila-ai-institute-minohealth-ai-labs-tuberculosis-classification-via-x-rays-challenge) I cannot upload the data to any public sites. Besides the files are huge anyways. But you can get the data [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/runmila-ai-institute-minohealth-ai-labs-tuberculosis-classification-via-x-rays-challenge/data)
